Descriptive and inferential statistics
--------------------------------------

population - whole group
sample - specific people selected from population

Inferential statistics - (to infer based on data)  only conducted on sample data
Analyze sample data to make predictions (or inference) on population
(Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression)

Descriptive statistics - (to summarize data)  need to do/conduct on sample and statistics
describing characteristics of a given data
(average , min, max,  variance, standard deviation)

-------------------------------
Mean, Median, Mode - Measures of central tendency

1) Mean -  average and mean is same sum of total divided by total numbers 
excel function = average(range)

2) Median - when we arrange all data points ascending/descending then middle point of series is Median 
in case of odd numbers take average of middle 2 numbers
excel function = median(range)

3) Mode - frequently occurring value in dataset
excel function = mode(range)
--------------------------------------------------

Percentile -

excel formula - =Percentile.inc(range,0.5)
Percentilerank.inc(cell value)
$ sign in excel to keep range same example $B$10:$B$20 likewise
------------------------------

range = max - min
if outlier in data we need to use IQR inter Quartile range

25 - Q1,  Q2- 50  Q3- 75

between Q1 and Q3 its IQR its robust against outlier 

range and IQR called measures of dispersion gives idea about data distribution

---------------------------
lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_limit = Q3+1.5*IQR

-----------------------

variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution is It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean

The smaller the variance the less spread out the data is Conversely the larger the variance the more spread out the data is

Standard Deviation is a measure the closer the data points are to the mean conversely the larger the standard deviation the more spread out the points are

THe stock markets volatility is the best use case for variance and standard deviation.
